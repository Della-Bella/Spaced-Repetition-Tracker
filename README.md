**Spaced Repetition Tracker**

This project is a web application built for a Code Your Future assignment, designed to help users track learning topics based on the spaced repetition technique. The application allows users to add topics and automatically calculates a schedule of future revision dates (1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year).
This tool was built using plain HTML and JavaScript (ES Modules), with a strong focus on logic, functionality, and accessibility over visual styling.

**Live Demo:** https://piscine-space-repetition.netlify.app/

**Core Features**
* User Selection: Choose from a list of pre-defined users to manage separate learning agendas.
* Add New Topics: An accessible form allows users to add a new topic and its starting date.
* Date Picker: The date input defaults to today's date for a smooth user experience.
* Automatic Revision Scheduling: Automatically calculates and stores five future revision dates for every new topic.
* Dynamic Agenda Display: The user's agenda is displayed in chronological order, automatically hiding any revision dates that are in the past.
* Persistent Storage: Uses localStorage via the provided helper functions to save user agendas between sessions.

**Technologies Used**
* HTML5
* JavaScript (ES6 Modules)
* (No custom CSS, as per project requirements)
